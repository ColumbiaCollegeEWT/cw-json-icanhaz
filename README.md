CW: Working with JSON & ICanHaz
===============================

For this exercise, you're going to work with a pre-built JSON object and the ICanHaz templating object.

You'll need to create a template in *index.html*, then complete the TODO's in *game.js*.

You should *not* create any markup using jQuery.
